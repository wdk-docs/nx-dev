# @nrwl/angular:stories

Creates stories/specs for all components declared in a project.

## Usage

```bash
nx generate stories ...
```

By default, Nx will search for `stories` in the default collection provisioned in `workspace.json`.

You can specify the collection explicitly as follows:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:stories ...
```

Show what will be generated without writing to disk:

```bash
nx g stories ... --dry-run
```

## Options

### name (_**required**_)

Type: `string`

The name of the project.

### cypressProject

Type: `string`

The Cypress project to generate the stories under. This is inferred from `name` by default.

### generateCypressSpecs

Type: `boolean`

Specifies whether to automatically generate `*.spec.ts` files in the Cypress e2e app generated by the `cypress-configure` generator.
