# @nrwl/angular:storybook-migrate-defaults-5-to-6

Generates default Storybook configuration files using Storybook version >=6.x specs, for projects that already have Storybook instances and configurations of versions <6.x.

## Usage

```bash
nx generate storybook-migrate-defaults-5-to-6 ...
```

By default, Nx will search for `storybook-migrate-defaults-5-to-6` in the default collection provisioned in `workspace.json`.

You can specify the collection explicitly as follows:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:storybook-migrate-defaults-5-to-6 ...
```

Show what will be generated without writing to disk:

```bash
nx g storybook-migrate-defaults-5-to-6 ... --dry-run
```

## Options

### all

Default: `true`

Type: `boolean`

Generate new Storybook configurations for all Storybook instances across all applications and libraries.

### keepOld

Default: `true`

Type: `boolean`

Keep the old configuration files by placing them in a folder called `.old_storybook`.

### name

Type: `string`

Library or application name for which you want to generate the new Storybook configuration. Leave empty to upgrade all Storybook instances. Only use this if you want to do a gradual migration.
