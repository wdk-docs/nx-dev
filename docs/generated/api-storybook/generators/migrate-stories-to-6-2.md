# @nrwl/storybook:migrate-stories-to-6-2

Migrate stories syntax to 6.2

## Usage

```bash
nx generate migrate-stories-to-6-2 ...
```

By default, Nx will search for `migrate-stories-to-6-2` in the default collection provisioned in `workspace.json`.

You can specify the collection explicitly as follows:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/storybook:migrate-stories-to-6-2 ...
```

Show what will be generated without writing to disk:

```bash
nx g migrate-stories-to-6-2 ... --dry-run
```
