# affected:build

Build applications and publishable libraries affected by changes

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:build
```

[Install `nx` globally](/getting-started/nx-setup#install-nx) to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpx nx`.

### Examples

Run build in parallel:

```bash
nx affected:build --parallel=5
```

Run the build target for all projects:

```bash
nx affected:build --all
```

Run build for all the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:build --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:build --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the last commit on main:

```bash
nx affected:build --base=main~1 --head=main
```
