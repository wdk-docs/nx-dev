# affected:libs

Print libraries affected by changes

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:libs
```

[Install `nx` globally](/getting-started/nx-setup#install-nx) to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpx nx`.

### Examples

Print the names of all the libs affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:libs --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Print the names of all the libs affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:libs --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Print the names of all the libs affected by the last commit on main:

```bash
nx affected:libs --base=main~1 --head=main
```
