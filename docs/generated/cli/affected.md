# affected

Run target for affected projects

## Usage

```bash
nx affected
```

[Install `nx` globally](/getting-started/nx-setup#install-nx) to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpx nx`.

### Examples

Run custom target for all affected projects:

```bash
nx affected --target=custom-target
```

Run tests in parallel:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --parallel=5
```

Run the test target for all projects:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --all
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected --target=test --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by the last commit on main:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --base=main~1 --head=main
```
