# Configuration: project.json and nx.json

There are two main types of configuration in every Nx workspace: [project configuration](#project-configuration)
and [the global Nx CLI configuration](#cli-configuration).

Projects can be configured in `package.json` (if you use npm scripts and not Nx executors) and `project.json` (if you
use Nx executors). Both `package.json` and `project.json` files are located in each project's folder. Nx merges the two
files to get each project's configuration. This guide covers the `project.json` case.

> Angular developers can also configure projects in angular.json. Read [this guide](/getting-started/nx-and-angular#angularjson) for more information.

## Project Configuration

The `project.json` file contains configuration specific to its project. This file is often created when you use Nx
Plugins. It configures custom executors, which are used instead of npm scripts. Custom executors are typed, toolable and provide a
lot more flexibility for running long-live processes. They are also more composable.

If you satisfied with npm scripts though, you will never see a `project.json` file in your workspace. But we encourage
you to explore Nx Plugins and the power they bring.

Let's look at the following `project.json`:

```json
{
  "root": "libs/mylib/",
  "sourceRoot": "libs/mylib/src",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "test": {
      "executor": "@nrwl/jest:jest",
      "outputs": [],
      "dependsOn": [
        {
          "target": "build",
          "projects": "self"
        }
      ],
      "options": {
        "jestConfig": "libs/mylib/jest.config.js",
        "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig.spec.json"
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "executor": "@nrwl/js:tsc",
      "outputs": ["dist/libs/mylib"],
      "dependsOn": [
        {
          "target": "build",
          "projects": "dependencies"
        }
      ],
      "options": {
        "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig.lib.json",
        "main": "libs/mylib/src/main.ts"
      },
      "configurations": {
        "production": {
          "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig-prod.lib.json"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "tags": ["scope:myteam"],
  "implicitDependencies": ["anotherlib"]]
}
```

- `root` tells Nx the location of the library including its sources and configuration files.
- `sourceRoot` tells Nx the location of the library's source files.
- `projectType` is either 'application' or 'library'. The project type is used in project graph viz and in a few aux
  commands.

### Targets

Let's look at a sample test target:

```json
{
  "test": {
    "executor": "@nrwl/jest:jest",
    "outputs": [],
    "dependsOn": [
      {
        "target": "build",
        "projects": "self"
      }
    ],
    "options": {
      "jestConfig": "libs/mylib/jest.config.js",
      "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig.spec.json"
    }
  }
}
```

**Target Name**

The name of the target `test` means that you can invoke it as follows: `nx test mylib` or `nx run mylib:test`. The name
isn't significant in any other way. If you rename it to, for example, `mytest`, you will be able to run as
follows: `nx mytest mylib` or `nx run mylib:mytest`.

**Executor**

The `executor` property tells Nx what function to invoke when you run the target. `"@nrwl/jest:jest"` tells Nx to find
the `@nrwl/jest` package, find the executor named `jest` and invoke it with the options.

**Options**

The `options` provides a map of values that will be passed to the executor. The provided command line args will be
merged into this map. I.e., `nx test mylib --jestConfig=libs/mylib/another-jest.config.js` will pass the following to
the executor:

```json
{
  "jestConfig": "libs/mylib/another-jest.config.js",
  "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig.spec.json"
}
```

**Configurations**

The `configurations` property provides extra sets of values that will be merged into the options map.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "executor": "@nrwl/js:tsc",
    "outputs": ["dist/libs/mylib"],
    "dependsOn": [
      {
        "target": "build",
        "projects": "dependencies"
      }
    ],
    "options": {
      "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig.lib.json",
      "main": "libs/mylib/src/main.ts"
    },
    "configurations": {
      "production": {
        "tsConfig": "libs/mylib/tsconfig-prod.lib.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can select a configuration like this: `nx build mylib --configuration=production`
or `nx run mylib:build:configuration=production`.

The following code snippet shows how the executor options get constructed:

```javascript
require(`@nrwl/jest`).executors['jest']({ ...options, ...selectedConfiguration, ...commandLineArgs }
}) // Pseudocode
```

The selected configuration adds/overrides the default options, and the provided command line args add/override the
configuration options.

### Outputs

`"outputs": ["dist/libs/mylib"]` tells Nx where the `build` target is going to create file artifacts. The provided value
is actually the default, so we can omit it in this case. `"outputs": []` tells Nx that the `test` target doesn't create
any artifacts on disk.

### dependsOn

Targets can depend on other targets.

A common scenario is having to build dependencies of a project first before building the project. This is what
the `dependsOn` property of the `build` target configures. It tells Nx that before it can build `mylib` it needs to make
sure that `mylib`'s dependencies are built as well. This doesn't mean Nx is going to rerun those builds. If the right
artifacts are already in the right place, Nx will do nothing. If they aren't in the right place, but they are available
in the cache, Nx will retrieve them from the cache.

Another common scenario is for a target to depend on another target of the same project. For instance, `dependsOn` of
the `test` target tells Nx that before it can test `mylib` it needs to make sure that `mylib` is built, which will
result in `mylib`'s dependencies being built as well.

This configuration is usually not needed. Nx comes with reasonable defaults (imported in `nx.json`) which implement the
configuration above.

### tags

You can annotate your projects with `tags` as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "tags": ["scope:myteam"]
}
```

You can [configure lint rules using these tags](/structure/monorepo-tags) to, for instance, ensure that libraries belonging to `myteam` are not depended on by libraries belong to `theirteam`.

### implicitDependencies

Nx uses powerful source-code analysis to figure out your workspace's project graph. Some dependencies cannot be deduced
statically, so you can set them manually like this:

```json
{
  "root": "libs/mylib/",
  "sourceRoot": "libs/mylib/src",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {},
  "implicitDependencies": ["anotherlib"]
}
```

You can also remove a dependency as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "root": "libs/mylib/",
  "sourceRoot": "libs/mylib/src",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {},
  "implicitDependencies": ["!anotherlib"] # regardless of what Nx thinks, "mylib" doesn't depend on "anotherlib"
}
```

### workspace json

The `workspace.json` file in the root directory is optional. It's used if you want to list the projects in your workspace explicitly instead of Nx scanning the file tree for all `project.json` and `package.json` files.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "projects": {
    "myapp": "apps/myapp"
  }
}
```

- `"version": 2` tells Nx that we are using Nx's format for the `workspace.json` file.
- `projects` is a map of project names to their locations.

You could inline `project.json` files into `workspace.json`. This used to be the default, but it's no longer
recommended. If you have an existing workspace where the configuration is inlined,
run `nx g convert-to-nx-project --all`.

If you have an old workspace where the configuration version is set to 1, change the version number to 2 and
run `nx format`.

## CLI Configuration

The `nx.json` file configures the Nx CLI and project defaults.

The following is an expanded version showing all options. Your `nx.json` will likely be much shorter.

```json
{
  "npmScope": "happyorg",
  "affected": {
    "defaultBase": "main"
  },
  "workspaceLayout": {
    "appsDir": "demos",
    "libsDir": "packages"
  },
  "implicitDependencies": {
    "workspace.json": "*",
    "package.json": {
      "dependencies": "*",
      "devDependencies": "*"
    },
    "tsconfig.base.json": "*",
    "nx.json": "*"
  },
  "targetDependencies": {
    "build": [
      {
        "target": "build",
        "projects": "dependencies"
      }
    ]
  },
  "cli": {
    "defaultCollection": "@nrwl/js"
  },
  "generators": {
    "@nrwl/js:library": {
      "buildable": true
    }
  },
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "lint", "test", "e2e"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### NPM Scope

Tells Nx what prefix to use when generating library imports.

### Affected

Tells Nx which branch and HEAD to use when calculating affected projects.

- `defaultBase` defines the default base branch, defaulted to `main`.

### Workspace Layout

You can add a `workspaceLayout` property to modify where libraries and apps are located.

```json
{
  "workspaceLayout": {
    "appsDir": "demos",
    "libsDir": "packages"
  }
}
```

These settings would store apps in `/demos/` and libraries in `/packages/`. The paths specified are relative to the
workspace root.

### Files & Implicit Dependencies

Nx performs advanced source-code analysis to figure out the project graph of the workspace. So when you make a change,
Nx can deduce what can be broken by this change. Some dependencies between projects and shared files cannot be inferred
statically. You can configure those using `implicitDependencies`.

```json
{
  "implicitDependencies": {
    "workspace.json": "*",
    "package.json": {
      "dependencies": "*",
      "devDependencies": {
        "mypackage": ["mylib"]
      },
      "scripts": {
        "check:*": "*"
      }
    },
    "globalFile": ["myapp"],
    "styles/**/*.css": ["myapp"]
  }
}
```

In the example above:

- Changing `workspace.json` affects every project.
- Changing the `dependencies` property in `package.json` affects every project.
- Changing the `mypackage` property in `package.json` only affects `mylib`.
- Changing any of the custom check `scripts` in `package.json` affects every project.
- Changing `globalFile` only affects `myapp`.
- Changing any CSS file inside the `styles` directory only affects `myapp`.

### Target Dependencies

Targets can depend on other targets. A common scenario is having to build dependencies of a project first before
building the project. The `dependsOn` property in `package.json` can be used to define the list of dependencies of an
individual target.

Often the same `dependsOn` configuration has to be defined for every project in the repo, and that's when
defining `targetDependencies` in `nx.json` is helpful.

```json
{
  "targetDependencies": {
    "build": [
      {
        "target": "build",
        "projects": "dependencies"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The configuration above is identical to adding `{"dependsOn": [{"target": "build", "projects": "dependencies"]}` to
every build target of every project.

### CLI Options

The following command generates a new library: `nx g @nrwl/js:lib mylib`. After setting the `defaultCollection`property,
the lib is generated without mentioning the collection name: `nx g lib mylib`.

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "defaultCollection": "@nrwl/js"
  }
}
```

### Generators

Default generator options are configured in `nx.json` as well. For instance, the following tells Nx to always
pass `--buildable=true` when creating new libraries.

```json
{
  "generators": {
    "@nrwl/js:library": {
      "buildable": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Tasks Runner Options

> A task is an invocation of a target.

Tasks runners are invoked when you run `nx test`, `nx build`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`, and so on. The tasks runner
named "default" is used by default. Specify a different one like this `nx run-many --target=build --all --runner=another`.

Tasks runners can accept different options. The following are the options supported
by `"@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners"` and `"@nrwl/nx-cloud"`.

- `cacheableOperations` defines the list of targets/operations that are cached by Nx.
- `parallel` defines the max number of targets ran in parallel (in older versions of Nx you had to
  pass `--parallel --maxParallel=3` instead of `--parallel=3`).
- `captureStderr` defines whether the cache captures stderr or just stdout.
- `skipNxCache` defines whether the Nx Cache should be skipped. Defaults to `false`.
- `cacheDirectory` defines where the local cache is stored, which is `node_modules/.cache/nx` by default.
- `encryptionKey` (when using `"@nrwl/nx-cloud"` only) defines an encryption key to support end-to-end encryption of
  your cloud cache. You may also provide an environment variable with the key `NX_CLOUD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` that contains an
  encryption key as its value. The Nx Cloud task runner normalizes the key length, so any length of key is acceptable.
- `runtimeCacheInputs` defines the list of commands that are run by the runner to include into the computation hash
  value.
- `selectivelyHashTsConfig` only hash the path mapping of the active project in the `tsconfig.base.json` (e.g.,
  adding/removing projects doesn't affect the hash of existing projects). Defaults to `false`

`runtimeCacheInputs` are set as follows:

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "lint", "test", "e2e"],
        "runtimeCacheInputs": ["node -v"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can configure `parallel` in `nx.json`, but you can also pass them in the
terminal `nx run-many --target=test --parallel=5`.

## .nxignore

You may optionally add an `.nxignore` file to the root. This file is used to specify files in your workspace that should
be completely ignored by Nx.

The syntax is the same as
a [`.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring).

**When a file is specified in the `.nxignore` file:**

1. Changes to that file are not taken into account in the `affected` calculations.
2. Even if the file is outside an app or library, `nx workspace-lint` won't warn about it.

## Validating the configuration

If at any point in time you want to check if your configuration is in sync, you can use
the [workspace-lint](/cli/workspace-lint) executor:

```bash
nx workspace-lint
```

This will identify any projects with no files in the configured project root folder, as well as any file that's not part
of any project configured in the workspace.
