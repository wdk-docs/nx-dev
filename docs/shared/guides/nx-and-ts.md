# Nx 和 TypeScript

> The build system for TypeScript that TypeScript deserves

The `@nrwl/js` package ships with corresponding generators and executors that best work when it comes to developing TypeScript applications and libraries.

> Note, you can also opt-out of TypeScript and use plain JavaScript by passing the `--js` flag to the generators.

`@nrwl/js` is particularly useful if you want to

- Create framework-agnostic TypeScript libraries within an existing Nx workspace (say to use in your React, Node or Angular app)
- Publish TypeScript packages to NPM

To get started with TypeScript packages in Nx, either add the `@nrwl/js` package to an existing Nx workspace or generate a new Nx workspace using the `--preset=ts` preset.

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace happynrwl -–preset=ts
```

Generating a new workspace creates a lightweight setup with a `packages` and `tools` folder.
The `tools` folder is where you can add monorepo specific scripts and custom Nx generators, the `packages` folder is where all our TS based libs will live.

```treeview
happynrwl/
├── packages/
├── tools/
├── workspace.json
├── nx.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

As with most Nx plugins, `@nrwl/js` comes with a set of generators to quickly scaffold new TypeScript libraries as well as TypeScript applications.
Let’s have a look at an example.

## 创建一个新的基于 TypeScript 的库

We can use Nx Console and choose the `@nrwl/js:library` generator or directly use the following command:

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/js:library --name=hello-tsc --buildable
```

This creates a new library in the `packages/hello-tsc` folder that already comes with both ESLint and Jest set up and ready to use.

You can run `nx lint hello-tsc` to run linting or `nx test hello-tsc` to run Jest tests.

Note, by passing the `--buildable` flag, our library can be built.

```bash
nx build hello-tsc
```

The output of the build step is placed into the `dist/packages/hello-tsc` by default.

## 创建一个基于 TypeScript 的应用

Apart from setting up TypeScript libraries, you can also setup a plain TypeScript application that is framework agnostic and consists of an entry point script that can be easily run with Node, to develop a CLI or framework agnostic backend application.

To generate a new framework agnostic TS application, run

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/js:app demoapp
```

Applications also come with a “serve” target, that allow you to run the app in watch mode:

```bash
nx serve demoapp
```

## 导入库

All the libraries generated within the Nx workspace are configured with corresponding TypeScript path mappings in the root-level `tsconfig.base.json` file:

```json
{
  "compileOnSave": false,
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "paths": {
      "@happynrwl/hello-swc": ["packages/hello-swc/src/index.ts"],
      "@happynrwl/hello-tsc": ["packages/hello-tsc/src/index.ts"]
    }
  },
}
```

This allows you to easily import from libraries, by using the corresponding TypeScript path mapping.
The following shows an example of importing the `helloTsc` function from the `hello-tsc` library into the `tsapp` application (the same method works between libraries as well):

```typescript
// file: packages/tsapp/src/index.ts

// importing from hello-tsc
import { helloTsc } from '@happynrwl/hello-tsc';

// use the function
helloTsc();

console.log(`Running ${tsapp()}`);
```

## 使用 SWC 作为编译器

Nx also ships with support to use SWC instead of TSC.
When generating a new library/application just pass the `--compiler=swc`.

Here's an example of generating a new library:

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/js:library --name=hello-tsc --buildable --compiler=swc
```

Alternatively, if you already have an existing tsc based library/application, you can run the `@nrwl/js:convert-to-swc` generator to migrate the package from TSC to SWC.

The following command converts the `hello-tsc` library to SWC:

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/js:convert-to-swc --name=hello-tsc
```

## 使用 NPM 脚本而不是 Nx 执行器

If you want to use NPM scripts rather than Nx executors, you can use the `--config=npm-scripts`:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/js:lib mylib --config=npm-scripts
```

The Nx generator then creates NPM scripts in the generated library's `package.json` (rather than in the `project.json`):

```json
// packages/mylib/package.json
{
  "name": "@happynrwl/mylib",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "type": "commonjs",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "echo 'implement build'",
    "test": "echo 'implement test'"
  }
}
```

To run these scripts with Nx, use the same syntax as Nx executors.
`nx build mylib` or `nx test mylib` will build or test your library, respectively.

## 将你的 TypeScript 包发布到 NPM

Nx doesn’t provide an out of the box process for publishing and leaves it to the developer to invoke the final command.
The reason for this is that the actual publishing process can be very specific to your project and target you deploy to and might have a lot of custom pre-deployment setup (e.g.
generating changelogs, determining semver etc.).
Make sure to check out our [community page](/community) as there are a lot of community provided packages integrating into the publishing process.

However, integrating your own custom publishing process with Nx can be very straightforward, especially with the help of Nx [run-commands](/executors/run-commands-builder) and [“Target Dependencies”](/configuration/projectjson#dependson).

To add a new run-command to our project, we can leverage the `run-command` generator:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/workspace:run-commands publish --project hello-tsc --command 'npm publish --tag=latest --access public'
```

This adds a new `publish` target to our existing `project.json` configuration of the `hello-tsc` project.
Let's also make sure to adjust the `cwd` (current working directory) of our command, which should be the output folder of the `hello-tsc` package.

```json
{
  "root": "packages/hello-tsc",
  "sourceRoot": "packages/hello-tsc/src",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "build": { ...
},
    "lint": { ...
},
    "test": { ...
},
    "publish": {
      "executor": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
      "outputs": [],
      "options": {
        "command": "npm publish --tag=latest --access public",
        "cwd": "dist/packages/hello-tsc"
      }
    }
  },
  "tags": []
}
```

With that, we're all set up.
By running the following commands we can publish our package to NPM.

```bash
nx build hello-tsc
nx publish hello-tsc
```

We can automate this even further by leveraging the `targetDependencies` feature.
There's clearly a dependency between `build` and `publish`, in that we want to make sure the `build` happens before the `publish` command.
We can define this relationship in the `nx.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "targetDependencies": {
    ...
    "publish": [
      {
        "target": "build",
        "projects": "self"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

Now, just running `nx publish hello-tsc` will automatically run the `nx build hello-tsc` command first.
And of course, if `build` has already run, it won't execute again, thanks to [Nx computation caching](/using-nx/caching).
