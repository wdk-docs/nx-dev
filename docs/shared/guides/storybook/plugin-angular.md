# Storybook

![Storybook logo](/shared/storybook-logo.png)

Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

This guide will briefly walk you through using Storybook within an Nx workspace.

## Add the Storybook plugin

```bash
yarn add --dev @nrwl/storybook
```

## Generating Storybook Configuration

You can generate Storybook configuration for an individual project with this command:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:storybook-configuration project-name
```

## Running Storybook

Serve Storybook using this command:

```bash
nx run project-name:storybook
```

## Anatomy of the Storybook setup

When running the Nx Storybook generator, it'll configure the Nx workspace to be able to run Storybook seamlessly. It'll create

- a global Storybook configuration
- a project specific Storybook configuration

The **global** Storybook configuration allows to set addon-ons or custom webpack configuration at a global level that applies to all Storybook's within the Nx workspace. You can find that folder at `.storybook/` at the root of the workspace.

```treeview
<workspace name>/
├── .storybook/
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── apps/
├── libs/
├── nx.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── etc...
```

The project-specific Storybook configuration is pretty much similar what you would have for a non-Nx setup of Storybook. There's a `.storybook` folder within the project root folder.

```treeview
<project root>/
├── .storybook/
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── preview.js
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
└── etc...
```

### Using Addons

To register a [Storybook addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/) for all storybook instances in your workspace:

1. In `/.storybook/main.js`, in the `addons` array of the `module.exports` object, add the new addon:
   ```typescript
   module.exports = {
   stories: [...],
   ...,
   addons: [..., '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
   };
   ```
2. If a decorator is required, in each project's `<project-path>/.storybook/preview.js`, you can export an array called `decorators`.

   ```typescript
   import someDecorator from 'some-storybook-addon';
   export const decorators = [someDecorator];
   ```

**-- OR --**

To register an [addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/) for a single storybook instance, go to that project's `.storybook` folder:

1. In `main.js`, in the `addons` array of the `module.exports` object, add the new addon:
   ```typescript
   module.exports = {
   stories: [...],
   ...,
   addons: [..., '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
   };
   ```
2. If a decorator is required, in `preview.js` you can export an array called `decorators`.

   ```typescript
   import someDecorator from 'some-storybook-addon';
   export const decorators = [someDecorator];
   ```

## Auto-generate Stories

The `@nrwl/angular:storybook-configuration` generator has the option to automatically generate `*.stories.ts` files for each component declared in the library.

```treeview
<some-folder>/
├── my.component.ts
└── my.component.stories.ts
```

You can re-run it at a later point using the following command:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:stories <project-name>
```

## Cypress tests for Stories

Both `storybook-configuration` generator gives the option to set up an e2e Cypress app that is configured to run against the project's Storybook instance.

To launch Storybook and run the Cypress tests against the iframe inside of Storybook:

```bash
nx run project-name-e2e:e2e
```

The url that Cypress points to should look like this:

`'/iframe.html?id=buttoncomponent--primary&args=text:Click+me!;padding;style:default'`

- `buttoncomponent` is a lowercase version of the `Title` in the `*.stories.ts` file.
- `primary` is the name of an individual story.
- `style=default` sets the `style` arg to a value of `default`.

Changing args in the url query parameters allows your Cypress tests to test different configurations of your component. You can [read the documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/writing-stories/args#setting-args-through-the-url) for more information.

### Example Files

**\*.component.stories.ts file**

```typescript
import { moduleMetadata, Story, Meta } from '@storybook/angular';
import { ButtonComponent } from './button.component';

export default {
  title: 'ButtonComponent',
  component: ButtonComponent,
  decorators: [
    moduleMetadata({
      imports: [],
    }),
  ],
} as Meta<ButtonComponent>;

const Template: Story<ButtonComponent> = (args: ButtonComponent) => ({
  component: ButtonComponent,
  props: args,
});

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  text: 'Click me!',
  padding: 0,
  style: 'default',
};
```

**Cypress \*.spec.ts file**

```typescript
describe('shared-ui', () => {
  beforeEach(() =>
    cy.visit(
      '/iframe.html?id=buttoncomponent--primary&args=text:Click+me!;padding;style:default'
    )
  );

  it('should render the component', () => {
    cy.get('storybook-trial-button').should('exist');
  });
});
```
