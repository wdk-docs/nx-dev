# @nrwl/angular:scam-directive

Generate a directive with an accompanying Single Component Angular Module (SCAM).

## Usage

```bash
nx generate scam-directive ...
```

By default, Nx will search for `scam-directive` in the default collection provisioned in `workspace.json`.

You can specify the collection explicitly as follows:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:scam-directive ...
```

Show what will be generated without writing to disk:

```bash
nx g scam-directive ... --dry-run
```

### path (**hidden**)
