# affected:graph

Graph dependencies affected by changes. Alias: affected:dep-graph

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:graph
```

[Install `nx` globally](/getting-started/nx-setup#install-nx) to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpx nx`.

### Examples

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:graph --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Save the project graph of the workspace in a json file, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD --file=output.json
```

Generate a static website with project graph data in an html file, highlighting the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD --file=output.html
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the last commit on main:

```bash
nx affected:graph --base=main~1 --head=main
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, highlight the projects affected, but exclude project-one and project-two:

```bash
nx affected:graph --exclude=project-one,project-two
```
