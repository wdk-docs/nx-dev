# Nx Micro-Frontend Example

This repository contains a single book store website that serves a React app for some routes and an Angular app for other routes. Both apps make use of web components to share UI.

The repository is kept up to date with the latest version of Nx and is used as a smoke test for migrations to new versions of Nx.
