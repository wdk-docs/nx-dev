# Adding Nx to Lerna/Yarn/PNPM/NPM Workspace

> In our teams we see a shift away from Lerna and a strong preference to use Nx for managing JavaScript-based monorepos.

If you have a monorepo that is powered by Lerna, Yarn, PNPM, or NPM, you can make it a lot faster by running the
following:

```bash
npx add-nx-to-monorepo
```

Watch this 3-min video to see how the command works and what next steps are:

`npx add-nx-to-monorepo` does the following:

1. Add Nx to your package.json.
2. Create `nx.json`, containing all the necessary configuration for Nx.
3. Set up a `tsconfig` file mapping if needed.
4. Set up Nx Cloud (if you chose "yes").

## What You Get Right Away

### Run Any Npm Scripts

After you run the command above, you can run any npm script using Nx. For instance, if `myproj` has a `build` script,
you can invoke it using `nx build myproj`. If you pass any flags, they are forwarded to the underlying script.

### Parallelization and Task Invariants

Nx knows how your projects relate to each other. For instance, if Project A depends on Project B, Nx will build Project
B first before building Project A.

When you run `nx build myproj`, Nx doesn't just build `myproj`, it first makes sure the results of building
all `myproj`'s dependencies are in the right place. If the right files are in the right place, Nx will do nothing. If
not, Nx will check if the right files are in its computation cache. If yes, Nx will restore them. If not, Nx will build
the dependencies. **In other words, Nx will use the faster way to get the context for building `myproj` ready.** Nx also
knows which tasks can run in parallel and which tasks cannot be. Nx will parallelize the tasks without breaking any
invariants.

Finally, Nx is also much better at minimising your CPU's idle time, so running the same command via Nx will often be **a
lot** faster than using Lerna.

### Computation Caching

Nx supports computation caching. If it has seen the computation you are trying to perform, it's going extract the result
from its cache instead of running it. To see it in action, run the same command twice: `nx build myproj` and then
again `nx build myproj`. This cache can be shared with your teammates and your CI. Your whole organisation will never
build or test the same thing twice when using Nx.

In addition to restoring all the files, Nx replays the terminal output as well, so you don't lose any information when
running a cached command. Other tools performing computation caching (e.g., Turborepo) change the terminal output of the
commands you run. They don't preserve animations and colors. We instrument Node.js to be able to capture terminal output
as is. When running, say, an npm script via Nx, the output will not be modified. The same is true when Nx restores the
output from cache.

### Distributed Task Execution

Nx is the only build system used by the JavaScript community that supports this feature, and **this is the most powerful
feature of Nx.**

Imagine you are running `nx affected --build`. Normally this command runs the build target for the affected projects in
parallel on the same machine. However, if you enable distributed task execution, the command will send the task graph to
Nx Cloud. Nx Cloud agents will then pick up the tasks to execute them.

This happens transparently. If an agent needs the output of `lib1` to build `app1`, and some agent built `lib1`, the
first agent is going to fetch the needed output before running the build task.

As agents complete tasks, the main job where you invoked nx affected `--build` will start receiving created files and
terminal outputs. After nx affected `--build` completes, the machine will have the build files and all the terminal
outputs as if it ran it locally.

**Using Distributed Task Execution you can keep your CI fast, with practically no effort, regardless of the size of your
workspace.**

### Affected Commands

Nx automatically analyzes your workspace to know what projects are affected by your commit. Simply
run: `nx affected --target=test` to see it in action. Often, Nx is able to do a better job detecting affected than other
tools because it looks not just at the changed files but also at the nature of the changes.

### Workspace Visualization

Run `nx graph` to see a visualization of your workspace. `nx affected:graph` shows what is affected by your
commit. `nx graph --watch` watches your workspace for changes and updates the visualization.

### GitHub integration

If you said "yes" to Nx Cloud, you can enable Nx Cloud - GitHub integration to get a much better overview of what
happens in your PRs.

## Lerna and Nx Command Comparison

Lerna:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build:all": "lerna run build",
    "build:app1": "lerna run build --scope=app1",
    "build:since": "lerna run build --since=main",
    "test:app": "lerna run test",
    "test:app1": "lerna run test --scope=app1",
    "test:since": "lerna run test --since=main",
    "dev": "lerna run dev --stream --parallel",
    "dev:app1": "lerna run dev --stream --scope=app1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "*"
  }
}
```

Nx + Lerna:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build:all": "nx run-many --target=build --all",
    "build:app1": "nx build app1",
    "build:since": "nx affected --target=build",
    "test:all": "nx run-many --target=test --all",
    "test:app1": "nx test app1",
    "test:since": "nx affected --target=test",
    "dev": "nx run-many --target=dev --all",
    "dev:app1": "nx dev app1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "*",
    "@nrwl/workspace": "*",
    "@nrwl/tao": "*"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

All this works without your having to change your repo in any way. Whatever setup you have still works the same way but
faster and with better dev ergonomics. But Nx enables much more than that.

Nx is like a VS Code of build tools. It has a very powerful core, but it's really the plugins and extra capabilities
that really transform how you develop.

Nx has first class support for React, Next.js, React Native, Angular, Node, NestJS, Jest, Cypress, Storybook and
many more. All the plugins are designed to work together and create a cohesive and pleasant to use dev environment.

In addition, Nx makes a lot of things much easier, like building large apps incrementally, distributing CI (no point in
doing caching unless you can do that), enforcing best practices, building design systems.

## Troubleshooting

The `add-nx-to-monorepo` command does its best to figure out what projects you have in the repo, but you can exclude
them by creating `.nxignore` file.

```text
third_party # nx will ignore everything in the third-party dir
```

Nx can add a root tsconfig to your repo with something like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "one": ["packages/one/index"],
      "one/*": ["packages/one/*"],
      "two": ["packages/two/index"],
      "two/*": ["packages/two/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This tsconfig isn't used for building or testing. It's only used to teach Nx how to resolve imports, so Nx can do its
import source code analysis. If the path mappings are deduced incorrectly, feel free to change them.

Lerna only analyses package.json files. Nx does that, but in addition it also analyses all JavaScript/TypeScript files to make
sure it understands the project graph of your workspace.

If you want to disable the source code analysis, to make Nx match Lerna, add the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "pluginsConfig": {
    "@nrwl/js": {
      "analyzeSourceFiles": false
    }
  }
}
```
