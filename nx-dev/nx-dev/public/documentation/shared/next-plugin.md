# Next.js Plugin

The Nx Plugin for Next.js contains executors and generators for managing Next.js applications and libraries within an Nx workspace. It provides:

- Scaffolding for creating, building, serving, linting, and testing Next.js applications.
- Integration with building, serving, and exporting a Next.js application.
- Integration with React libraries within the workspace.

See the [Next.js guide](/guides/nextjs) for information about using Next.js and Nx.
